# Ansible first steps

Ansible is a configuration-management system. I am still learning it.

This is my first project: use Ansible to manage key developer software on my
new Mac.  For further details, see the [README](localhost/README.md) for the
`localhost` directory.

Vaporware: my next project will be to use Ansible to configure a server using
Vagrant and VirtualBox.
